# RepeatableCalendarEvents
https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/271544-repeatablecalendarevents

Addon to automatically create calendar events in regular intervals.

 

Use **/RCE** or **/RepeatableCalendarEvents** to open the list of repeated calendar events and create new calendar events.

 

**How it works:** After you created a new event or shortly after login the addon will check if a new calendar entry must be created. If that is the case, the addon shows you a confirmation button (which is necessary to comply with Blizzard Interface rules).

While the addon checks for new events you shouldn't work with the ingame calender. The addon prints a message ("Calendar update finished") when it's work is completed.
